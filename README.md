# DoorAlarm
Alarm you can mount on cabinet doors, freezer doors, refridgerator doors, that will flash as long as door is open, and make a sound if kept open for a longer period of time.

This project is a work-in-progress, but created a repo to track progress, which will be updated as I progress.
The main idea is a LED-diode in a circuit with a spring-loaded switch. this switch will be opened by a small shaft mounted on the door of whatever you want to monitor, causing the circuit to be open when the door is closed, and closing the circuit when door is open. the first goal of this project is finishing a prototype with the LED, and expanding this with sound after a working product.

The main focus is to create something cheap and easy, relying solely on 3D-printed and analog parts for its design.

pictures and tutorial will be added in the future.
